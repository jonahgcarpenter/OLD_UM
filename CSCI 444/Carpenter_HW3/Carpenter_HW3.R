# First, how many pounds of honey are needed to produce a gallon of mead? Now, what are the top 5 state that produce mead? Of these, which states ARE in the top 10 honey producing states? What was their 2021 production of honey in pounds?

How many pounds of apples did this state harvest in 2021? Let's compare - how many pounds of apples did the top apple producing state harvest in 2021? What number is this state on the top 5 cidery states?
# 16 pounds per, NM harvested 7 million pounds, whereas the top state was Washington at 6.4 billion pounds and is not listed for cider

# How many pounds of rice are needed to make ~2 gallons of sake? What are the top 5 states that produce sake? Of these, which states ARE in the top 6 rice producing states (you may use 2020 data)? What was their rice production in pounds?
# 10-12 pounds per, California harvested 4.4 million tons
