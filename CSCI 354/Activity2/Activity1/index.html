        Batman, also known as Bruce Wayne, is from DC Comics. Batman is inferior in power compared to the rest of the Justice League but maintains his status as a founder and leader with his detective skills. Although he can hold his own in combat when needed, Batman relies on his intellect. He first appeared in Detective Comics #27 but is best portrayed by Christian Bale in Christopher Nolan's 3-film series.
