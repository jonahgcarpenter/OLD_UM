        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
            As students—and perhaps even for teachers and staff—it can be challenging to keep up with all the events happening within the department and across the University as a whole. Why not create a webpage dedicated specifically to CS department events, rather than relying on email notifications? This would solve two major issues: reducing the overwhelming email spam from departmental events and helping students stay informed about important happenings they might otherwise overlook.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, the CS department lacks a dedicated page for events, which makes this the perfect opportunity to design one. While the UM website does have an event calendar, it often overlooks smaller events that could still be important to certain individuals, such as the upcoming FBI info session on the 17th. Centralizing these events in one place would make it easier for everyone to follow and stay updated.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another major benefit would be reducing email spam, which I believe is a significant problem in the CS department. Typically, each event is announced individually via email, and with 2-3 events happening each week, along with other University-wide emails, it quickly adds up. By consolidating these into a webpage for CS-specific events—such as club meetings, seminars, and career opportunities—and sending out a weekly newsletter, we could clean up our inboxes, making it easier to spot more important emails.

    <section id="app-description">
        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
            The primary users of this application would be students, faculty, and staff interested in upcoming events within the department. Students, in particular, will benefit from having a centralized web page to use as a resource, rather than receiving 10 emails a day about various events and activities. This web app will also be valuable for anyone looking to participate in the department’s events, providing a more organized and efficient way to stay informed. In essence, the app caters to anyone seeking a more streamlined, centralized way to view and manage upcoming events, rather than relying solely on email.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users will be able to browse events such as club meetings, career opportunities, seminars, and other interesting activities they can participate in. Additionally, the app will allow users to filter and sort these events by categories, dates, and other relevant criteria. Each event listing will include important details such as the time, location, a brief description, and even an indicator of how many people are interested or planning to attend.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead of sifting through countless emails each week, users will be able to view all relevant events in one place, making it easier to stay informed. This could also inadvertently increase event attendance, as more people may become aware of events and discuss them with their peers.

    <section id="app-functionality-data">
        <h2>App Functionality and Data</h2>
        <h3>Functionality:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1: Users will begin by viewing and sorting through the various events to find one that matches their interests.</li>
            <li>Step 2: Based on their sorting preferences, users will then find an interesting event, which they can view individually for more information.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Data:</h3>
        <p>
            The app will include data about the events, such as the time, location, and description of what's going on. This information will be stored in a database, allowing users to filter and sort through the events while still being able to click on individual events to learn more.
        </p>
        <p>
            To avoid confusion, a "How To" page can be implemented to guide users on how to navigate the site. Users will also be able to view event details on a dedicated page without the need for further interaction.
        </p>

    <section id="images">
        <h2>Images</h2>
        <p>
            Any images used in the web application will be sourced to visually enhance the event listings. For example, images can show the building where the event is located or provide a glimpse of previous occurrences of an annual event, helping to entice users to participate. These images could be sourced from the web or directly provided by event organizers.
        </p>

      <h2>References</h2>
      <ul>

      </ul>
      <p>
          At the moment, the department’s website lacks anything specific to CS department events, and currently, the "News" tab—where information like this might be found—does not work.
